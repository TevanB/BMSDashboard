                    The following are rules that employees from BMS Boosting need to follow. This includes boosters, coaches and customer support. You accept these rules whenever you claim a boosting or coaching order.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. When boosting on a client’s account, the use of third party programs is completely forbidden.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. When boosting on a client’s account, you are not allowed to use/spend the client’s Blue Essence, Orange Essence, or Riot Points, without contacting BMS Boosting , and asking for permission.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. When interacting with a client during duo-boosts or coaching services, you are expected to treat them and everyone else in the game (during duo-boosts) with respect.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Getting a clients account account banned or chat restricted during a Solo-Boost is absolutely not acceptable and will result in consequences.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. There are minimal expected win-rates for Solo-Boosts, which you have to achieve when accepting a boost. These are listed below. You need to achieve these winrates in your first 20 games of the boost.<br>
                    <br>
                    Iron 4 – Gold 4 minimal winrate: 90% <br>
                    Gold 3 – Platinum 4 minimal winrate: 85% <br>
                    Platinum 3 – Diamond 4 minimal winrate: 75% <br>
                    Diamond 3 – Masters minimal winrate: 65% <br>
                    <br>
                    6. When using a clients account for a solo-Boost, you are not allowed to contact people on the clients friend list, or reveal any information about performing a boost. <br>
                    <br>
                    7. Trolling, intentionally going afk or intentionally feeding during any kind of boost is forbidden. <br>
                    <br>
                    8. Contacting a client outside of the Order Dashboard chat is forbidden unless approved by BMS Boosting management, if a client tries contacting you outside this Dashboard please report it to BMS Boosting Management. <br>
                    <br>
